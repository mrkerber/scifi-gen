----------------------------------------------make the unsplash search word by word rather than full phrase
In the data folder create a file of all image ids already used, search the list before tweet, if id has been used, reroll
separate the two unsplash functions, fetch and download
create a system for cleaning up and deleting old photos
look into cronie for automating the bot
fetch and save image author and add to tweet
checkout depositphotos.com for images
account for photos>8192x8192
look into chunk uploading images to twitter
